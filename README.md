# WeatherCheck

## Description

This application is able to show the current and next days weather forecast in a specific location given by the user. 

The technologies used were `ReactJS` along with the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/). I developed this simple site in order to learn more about how to use ReactJS.

I'm open to suggestions for new features even though isn't my main focus at the moment.
